# babysit-pr

Automate the PR review-fix-push cycle. Waits for CI, processes ALL review comments (bot and human), fixes code or defers, pushes, replies, and loops until clean.

## Initialization

1. **Determine PR number**:
   - If argument provided, use it directly
   - Otherwise, detect from current branch: `gh pr view --json number -q .number`
   - If no PR found, abort with message

2. **Get PR metadata**:
   ```bash
   gh pr view PR_NUMBER --json number,title,headRefName,baseRefName,url,author,state
   ```

3. **Check PR state and set mode**:
   - If `OPEN`: proceed normally (**live mode**)
   - If `MERGED`: switch to **follow-up mode** (see "Follow-Up Mode for Merged PRs" below)
   - If `CLOSED` (not merged): exit with message: "PR #NUMBER is closed without merge. Nothing to babysit."

4. **Handle dirty working directory**: Before switching branches, stash any uncommitted changes:
   ```bash
   git stash --include-untracked
   ```
   Pop the stash after checkout if it was created. Check `git stash list` to verify.

5. **Ensure on correct branch**:
   - **Live mode**: `git checkout HEAD_REF_NAME && git pull --rebase origin HEAD_REF_NAME`
   - **Follow-up mode**: See setup below

6. **Announce**: Print PR title, URL, branch, and mode (live / follow-up). Begin loop.

## Follow-Up Mode for Merged PRs

When the PR is already merged, reuse the **same branch name** — reset it to the base branch and apply fixes there.

### Setup
```bash
# Checkout base branch and update
git checkout BASE_REF_NAME
git pull origin BASE_REF_NAME

# Reset the original PR branch to base (safe — PR is already merged)
git checkout HEAD_REF_NAME       # e.g. fix/review-feedback
git reset --hard origin/BASE_REF_NAME
```

This gives a clean branch matching the current base, reusing the original branch name for the follow-up PR.

### Comment Processing
- Process comments the same as live mode (Phase B -> C)
- All fixes go on the reset `HEAD_REF_NAME` branch

### Reply Format (Follow-Up Mode)

**For FIX**:
```
[babysit-pr] Will be addressed in follow-up PR #{FOLLOW_UP_PR_NUMBER}.

<Brief explanation of what will be changed and why>
```

**For DEFER**:
```
[babysit-pr] Deferred — <category>.

<Explanation>
```

### After Processing All Comments
If any fixes were made:
1. Commit and push the branch (force push is OK here — the PR was already merged, branch is being reused):
   ```bash
   git push --force-with-lease origin HEAD_REF_NAME
   ```
2. Create a follow-up PR from the same branch:
   ```bash
   gh pr create --title "fix: address review comments from #NUMBER" \
     --body "Follow-up to #NUMBER. Addresses review comments:

   - <bullet for each fix>

   Original PR: #NUMBER"
   ```
3. Post replies on the **original PR** with the follow-up PR number
4. Print the follow-up PR URL in the summary

## Core Loop (max 5 iterations)

Track iteration count. Exit if iteration > 5 with summary of remaining issues.

**At the start of each iteration** (live mode only), check PR state:
```bash
gh pr view PR_NUMBER --json state -q .state
```
If state changed to `MERGED` during the loop: switch to follow-up mode for any remaining comments. If `CLOSED` (not merged), exit gracefully.

### Phase A: Wait for CI Checks

**Live mode only.** Skip this phase in follow-up mode.

> **CRITICAL**: You MUST NOT proceed to Phase B until ALL CI checks have either passed or failed. Never say "while waiting, I'll collect comments" — Phase B does not start until Phase A is fully complete. Bots (e.g. automated review bots) post new review comments AFTER CI runs complete, so collecting comments before CI finishes will miss them.

**Always use polling** — do NOT use `--watch` as it can hang or be interrupted:

```bash
# Poll every 30s until all checks reach a terminal state (pass/fail/skipped)
gh pr checks PR_NUMBER --json name,state,bucket
```

Poll loop:
1. Fetch checks with the command above
2. If any check has `state` of `IN_PROGRESS` or `QUEUED` (bucket `pending`): wait 30 seconds, repeat
3. If all checks have `state` of `SUCCESS`, `SKIPPED`, or terminal: proceed to Phase B
4. If any check has `state` of `FAILURE` or `ERROR`: read failing logs, fix, commit, push, restart Phase A
5. Maximum wait: 15 minutes. If checks still pending after 15 min, stop and report to user — do NOT proceed.

Note: `conclusion` is NOT a valid field — only `name`, `state`, `link`, `bucket`, `completedAt`, `description`, `event`, `startedAt`, `workflow` are available.

### Phase B: Collect Unresolved Review Comments

Process **ALL review comments** — from bots and humans alike. Do NOT filter by author type.

Fetch all comments in **two batch API calls**, then filter and cross-reference in memory. Do NOT make per-comment API calls for reply checks.

#### Step 1: Batch-fetch all review comments

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/PR_NUMBER/comments --paginate --jq '[.[] | {id, body, path, line, user_login: .user.login, user_type: .user.type, in_reply_to_id: .in_reply_to_id, created_at}]'
```

**Important**:
- Use `--jq` to extract only needed fields and produce a single valid JSON array. This avoids the concatenated-JSON problem that `--paginate` causes without `--jq`.
- Do NOT attempt to strip HTML comment markers (`<!-- -->`) inside `--jq` — `gh` escapes `!` as `\!` in jq strings, causing parse errors. Instead, fetch the raw `body` and strip bot noise (automated fix links, bot IDs, `<!-- DESCRIPTION START/END -->` blocks) in your own code after fetching.

#### Step 2: Batch-fetch all issue comments

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/PR_NUMBER/comments --paginate --jq '[.[] | {id, body, user_login: .user.login, user_type: .user.type, created_at}]'
```

#### Step 3: Identify actionable comments

Keep all comments that contain review feedback — from **any author** (bot or human). Skip:
- Comments that are purely informational (CI status reports, merge notifications)
- Comments from the PR author themselves (self-comments are usually notes, not review requests)
- Comments that are clearly just acknowledgments ("LGTM", "Looks good", thumbs up)

#### Step 4: Filter out already-resolved comments

Using the batch-fetched data (no additional API calls):

- **For review comments**: Build a map of `in_reply_to_id -> [reply comments]`. A comment is resolved if any reply in its thread contains `[babysit-pr]` in the body.
- **For issue comments**: Scan all issue comments after the target comment. If any subsequent comment contains `[babysit-pr]` and references the comment (by quoting or by proximity), consider it resolved.

#### Step 5: Exit check

If no unresolved comments remain, exit loop with success summary.

### Phase C: Process Each Comment

For each unresolved comment:

#### C1: Gather Context

- Read the file referenced in the comment (`path` field for review comments)
- Read the PR diff for that file: `gh pr diff PR_NUMBER -- FILE_PATH`
- Parse the comment body to understand what's being requested

#### C2: Classify — FIX or DEFER

**FIX** (actionable, clear, safe):
- Bug reports (null checks, off-by-one, missing error handling)
- Security issues (injection, XSS, secrets exposure)
- Style/convention violations (naming, formatting, imports)
- Straightforward performance issues (N+1, unnecessary allocations)
- Missing types or type errors
- Unused imports/variables
- Test improvements with clear direction
- Transaction safety (wrapping related operations in a transaction)

**DEFER** (subjective, risky, or out of scope):
- Architectural suggestions ("consider redesigning this module")
- Subjective preferences without project convention backing
- False positives (reviewer misunderstood the code)
- Changes requiring >50 lines of modification across multiple files
- Suggestions that contradict project conventions (check CLAUDE.md)
- Performance suggestions requiring benchmarking to validate
- Suggestions about code not in the PR diff

#### C3: Apply Fix or Draft Deferral

**If FIX**:
- Make the code change using Edit tool
- Keep changes minimal and focused on what the comment requests
- NEVER modify files outside the PR diff (live mode) or outside the files referenced by comments (follow-up mode)
- If the fix would touch >50 lines, STOP and ask the user for confirmation before proceeding
- Stage and note the fix for the commit in Phase D

**If DEFER**:
- Do not modify any code
- Prepare a deferral reply explaining why

#### C4: Queue Reply for Comment Thread

Queue replies — do NOT post them yet. They are posted in Phase D after the commit (so FIX replies can include the commit SHA).

**For review comments** (code-line comments), reply in-thread using `in_reply_to`:
```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/PR_NUMBER/comments \
  -X POST -f body="REPLY_BODY" -F in_reply_to=COMMENT_ID
```
**Note**: Do NOT use the `/pulls/comments/COMMENT_ID/replies` endpoint — it returns 404. Use `/pulls/PR_NUMBER/comments` with the `in_reply_to` field instead.

**For issue comments** (PR-level), reply on the PR:
```bash
gh pr comment PR_NUMBER --body "REPLY_BODY"
```

### Phase D: Commit, Push, Reply, and Loop

1. **If any fixes were made**:
   ```bash
   git add <specific files that were changed>
   git commit -m "fix: address review comments

   - <bullet point for each fix made>"
   ```
   - NEVER use `git add -A` or `git add .`
   - **Live mode**: Push normally: `git push origin BRANCH_NAME`
   - **Follow-up mode**: Force push is OK (branch was reset from merged PR): `git push --force-with-lease origin BRANCH_NAME`

2. **Post queued FIX replies** with the actual commit SHA from the push

   **Live mode reply format**:
   ```
   [babysit-pr] Fixed in COMMIT_SHA.

   <Brief explanation of what was changed and why>
   ```

   **Follow-up mode reply format**:
   ```
   [babysit-pr] Will be addressed in follow-up PR #{FOLLOW_UP_PR_NUMBER}.

   <Brief explanation of what will be changed and why>
   ```
   Note: In follow-up mode, create the PR first (Phase D step 5), then post replies with the PR number.

3. **Post DEFER replies** (these don't need a commit SHA):
   ```
   [babysit-pr] Deferred — <category>.

   <Explanation>
   ```

4. **If fixes were made in live mode**: Increment iteration counter, go back to Phase A — **wait for the new CI run to complete before collecting comments again**. New bot comments (e.g. automated review bots) appear only after CI finishes, so skipping the wait will miss them.

5. **If fixes were made in follow-up mode**: Create the follow-up PR (if not already created), then exit:
   ```bash
   gh pr create --title "fix: address review comments from #NUMBER" \
     --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
   ## Summary
   Follow-up to #NUMBER. Addresses review comments.

   - <bullet for each fix>

   Original PR: #NUMBER
   EOF
   )"
   ```

6. **If only deferrals (no code changes)**: Exit loop

### Phase E: Exit Summary

Print a summary table:

```
## babysit-pr Summary

PR: #NUMBER — TITLE
Mode: Live / Follow-up
Follow-up PR: #FOLLOW_UP_NUMBER (if applicable)
Iterations: N
Status: Clean / Has remaining issues

| # | File | Author | Comment | Action | Details |
|---|------|--------|---------|--------|---------|
| 1 | path/to/file.rb:42 | reviewer-bot | "Missing null check" | Fixed (abc1234) | Added nil guard |
| 2 | path/to/file.rb:78 | @reviewer | "Consider redesign" | Deferred | Architectural, out of scope |
```

If there are remaining issues (hit max iterations), list them clearly.

## Safety Guardrails

1. **Max 5 iterations** — prevents infinite loops
2. **Never force push in live mode** — only force push in follow-up mode (branch reset from merged PR)
3. **Never modify unrelated files** — in live mode, check file is in `gh pr diff --name-only`; in follow-up mode, only modify files referenced by comments
4. **Confirm before large changes** — if a single fix requires >50 lines changed, ask user
5. **Stage specific files** — never `git add -A` or `git add .`
6. **Idempotent replies** — `[babysit-pr]` prefix prevents re-processing
7. **Replies posted on original PR** — even in follow-up mode, replies go on the original PR thread
8. **Stash before branch switch** — always stash uncommitted changes before checkout

## Edge Cases

- **PR merges mid-loop**: If PR state changes to `MERGED` during live mode, switch to follow-up mode for remaining comments
- **Dirty working directory**: Stash uncommitted changes before switching branches, pop after
- **Deleted remote branch**: If the original branch was deleted after merge, `git checkout` will use the local ref or create fresh from base — `git push --force-with-lease` will recreate it on remote
- **Deleted files in PR**: Skip comments on files that were deleted in the PR
- **Outdated diff positions**: If the comment references a line that no longer exists after a push, note it in the reply as resolved by recent changes
- **Push failures**: If push fails in live mode, do NOT force push — alert the user and stop. In follow-up mode, `--force-with-lease` failures mean someone else pushed to the branch — alert and stop.
- **Rate limiting**: If GitHub API rate-limits, wait and retry once. If still limited, stop and report
- **No review comments**: If Phase B finds zero comments, skip to summary and report "No review comments found"
- **Binary files**: Skip comments on binary files
- **Self-comments**: Skip comments from the PR author (unless they explicitly request a change)
