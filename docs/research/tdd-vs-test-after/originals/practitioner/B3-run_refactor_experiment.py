"""Clean-room runner for the refactoring-cadence experiment (granularity x authorship).

Factors (and nothing more):
  - granularity:  none / one-shot / continuous refactoring
  - authorship:   single agent vs split (independent coder + tester)
  - plus the tdd-refactor reference arm
  - plus two test-first batch variants (ARMS' `batch` key): "big" (all tests for
    the whole task, then all code — all-tests-first-*) and "per-class" (tests
    batched and verified-red per class/unit, then implemented, before the next
    unit — batch-red-per-class-single, issue #1727)
INVARIANT (all arms): refactoring never changes the tests. Clear specs only. No
spec-plan-build arm. No reuse of prior scripts or data.

Each cell (task x arm x trial) runs build + a 3-change chain, fully isolated in
its own worktree and scratch HOME. One JSONL row per cell-stage.

Sensors (all defensive — a failure yields nulls, never a crashed cell):
  changeability: blast radius (git numstat across a change)
  modularity:    radon (cc, mi) + lizard (ccn, token, params)  [static, no model]
  test quality:  CORE/EDGE/change pass, mutation score, branch coverage, smells
  process:       refactor count (refactor: commits), attempted test churn during
                 refactor (must be 0 — the tests-frozen invariant check)
  cost:          cost_usd / tokens / turns from the dispatch JSON

Usage:
  python3 scripts/run_refactor_experiment.py --skip-dispatch            # free self-test
  python3 scripts/run_refactor_experiment.py --arm one-shot-single --task fare --trials 1

# ── arms: corrected design ───────────────────────────────────────────────
# INVARIANT in every arm: refactoring restructures production code only and leaves
# the tests unchanged. Tests change only to express new behavior (the change chain),
# never during a refactor step. We vary granularity x authorship; ordering is
# test-after for the granularity x authorship cells — the tdd-refactor reference and
# the batch arms (all-tests-first-*, batch-red-per-class-single) are test-first,
# differentiated by the `batch` key (absent = per-behavior TDD, "big" = whole-task,
# "per-class" = per-unit). Enforcement: a separate refactor dispatch has any
# test-file edits reverted to the pre-refactor ("green") snapshot. Inline-refactor
# arms (continuous, tdd) can't be reverted mid-dispatch, so their refactor-commit
# test churn is recorded as a violation flag.
